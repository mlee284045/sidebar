    <h2>Learn web development. Build awesome things.</h2>
    <p>
        You quit your job, you told your friends and family you're doing something crazy, maybe you moved here. You're ready to learn, intensively, for the next twelve weeks. By the time you're done, you'll be able to build pretty much anything you see on the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>Prove you can program.</h2>
    <p>
        First things first: let's make sure everyone is comfortable with the Python prework you did. Instead of a boring review lecture, try out these challenge problems. They range from easy to difficult and will test you on variables, loops, data structures, conditionals, and functions. They can be pretty fun, and they are similar to questions you might be asked in an interview. These types of problems are often referred to as "FizzBuzz", after one of the best known ones (you'll know it when you see it).
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not look up solutions online! But feel free to use the internet to refresh yourself on Python syntax or built-in methods. Don't let yourself get stuck on a single question. See how far you can get with these:
