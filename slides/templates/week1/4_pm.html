    <h2>Do it Yourself</h2>
    <p>Let's continue using our vehicle application and add to it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a static method on <code>Vehicle</code> which randomly chooses a direction (-180 to 180)</li>
        <li>Add a class method, which returns a new instance of that class, with a random color.</li>
        <li>Add a class method, which takes in another vehicle as an argument, and creates a new instance of the current class, with the passed in vehicle's speed, color, and direction. For example, if I called this method on a RaceCar, and passed it a Boat, it would create a new RaceCar with the Boat's speed, color, and direction</li>
        <li>Have your application now use these new methods to create and "drive" your different types of vehicles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Homework: Tic Tac Toe</h2>
    <p>Let's create a Tic Tac Toe game. You should apply what you learned about classes in the past few days, inheritance, and different kinds of methods</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create objects and objects to represent different parts of the game: Players, Game Board, X's and O's, the Game itself.</li>
        <li>Prompt 2 players back and forth to pick where they want to put their X's and O's.</li>
        <li>Every time a player makes a move, you'll need to check if one of the players has gotten 3 in a row.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some nice to have's:</p>
    <div class="col-8">
        <ul>
            <li>The Game Board has a method to display itself on the terminal after every move</li>
            <li>Running tally of which player has won more games and ties</li>
            <li><b>Bonus:</b> Choose to play against a computer player (easiest is have it pick a random space, more complicated would be to have it try to block 3 in a row)</li>
        </ul>
