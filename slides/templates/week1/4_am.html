        <h2>Zen of Python</h2>
        <p>We've now gotten a bit familiar with Python. Open up your python interpreter and run:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><pre><code>import this</code></pre></li>

        <h2>Zen of Python (Cont.)</h2>
<pre><code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</code></pre>

    <h2>Inheritance: Base classes and subclasses</h2>
    <p>Previously, we used an example of a Car class. But what about other types of vehicles?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stick shifts are still cars, but there are a few differences. Acceleration is limited by your current gear. Braking might stall the car.</li>
        <li>Boats are vehicles, they can accelerate, but not brake.</li>
        <li>Tanks can accelerate, brake, turn left and right, have a color. But they can also blow stuff up!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly there are a lot of similarities between different vehicle types, but also a number of variances in terms of properties and functionality. Object oriented Python uses inheritance as a way to de-duplicate this common functionality.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Common features are abstracted into base classes (also known as super classes)</li>
        <li>Derived classes (sub classes) inherit features from one or more base classes</li>
        <li>Additional features can then be added, or existing ones changed in the derived class</li>
        <li>Objects can be instantiated on a base class or a derived class</li>
        <li>Inheritance chains can be any length in Python</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Multiple Inheritance and Mixins</h2>
        <div class="col-12">
            <p>What happens if some of our Vehicles share the same functionality, but some don't?</p>
            <p>For example, what if we wanted to add windshield wipers to some of our vehicles.</p>
            <p>Python allows for objects to inherit from multiple classes. This is often called a Mixin, which allows us to share functionality between two classes</p>
            <p>This also allows us to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code and not duplicate our wiper code in two places.</p>

        <h2>Do it Yourself</h2>
        <p>Let's put it altogether in a python application</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create classes for the rest of the objects in the diagram. Pay attention to which classes they inherit from.</li>
            <li>Add print statements to the various methods so our output can inform us that the car is breaking or the boat has accelerated.</li>
            <li>Have your program create 1 instance of each of the following: RaceCar, StreetCar, Motorbike, AutoCar, Boat.</li>
            <li>Have your program drive and control each of the classes by calling the various methods. When you run it, there should be output describing what is happening.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Add a <code>RadioMixin</code> to some of your classes, which can turn the radio on and off as well as change the station.</p>
