    <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
    <p>
        Python is an open-source, free to use, programming language that runs on a variety of operating systems, including Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows. It was created by Guido Van Rossum, and ﬁrst released in 1991. Python gets its name from the UK TV series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, which Van Rossum was a great fan of. It is an <a target="_blank" href="http://javascript.about.com/od/hintsandtips/a/Interpreted-Or-Compiled.htm">interpreted</a>, object-oriented language that combines a very clear syntax with very powerful capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Python is a server-side programming language, and therefore has no direct control over the browser or front-end applications. In web development, server-side languages are typically used to process data, generate output in the form of HTML, and send it back to the client via a web-server application - such as Apache or Python’s own web-server. Python and other server-side languages, such as PHP and Perl, can also be used for general purpose programming on a server. The initial Python modules in this course will look at the use of Python as a general purpose language. Its use in a web development environment will be covered in later modules on Django etc.
    </p>
    <p>Python is widely used outside of web development, including in scientific communities and for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">ROBOTS</a>. It also has a <a target="_blank" href="https://us.pycon.org/">great</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/"> community</a>.</p>

    <h2>Writing Python programs</h2>
    <p>
        Yesterday you worked on a bunch of practice problems to level-set your knowledge of Python. The variables, conditionals, loops, and functions you created are the building blocks of Python programs. Today we're going to start writing programs that actually do things and allow users to interact with them, instead of just stand-alone functions. By the end of today, you'll have made

    <h2>Basic calculator: one problem, multiple solutions</h2>
    <p>I'm showing you two solutions because:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You should be familiar with different programming patterns. These patterns make up your toolkit, and the more tools you have the more different ways you'll be able to think of to tackle new problems.</li>
        <li>In programming, there are often many ways to solve the same problem. We'll review homework in class and instructors may provide solutions, but you should be comfortable with the idea that there is no one solution that will just be given to you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Do it yourself: Advanced Calculator</h2>
    <p>Turn the basic calculator we made together into an advanced calculator.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add multiplication and division as options.</li>
        <li>Refactor: ask the user if they want to use a basic or an advanced calculator. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are basic operations. Finding remainders, performing exponential functions, and taking square roots are advanced functions.</li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Do it yourself</h2>
    <p>Build <a target="_blank" href="http://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/practice/elkner/mathquiz.php">this math quiz program</a>. You might be able to reuse some of your code from the calculator, you might not. For point #5 in the instructions, 'mixed' means the user will get a random assortment of question types.</p>
    <p>Build <a target="_blank" href="http://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/practice/wilson/rockpaperscissors.php">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a>.</p>
    <p>Bonus: Try out both the strategies we covered today (or see if you can come up with another strategy).</p>
    <h4>Shirt Shuffle</h4>
    <p>You have a bunch of shirts. Each day, you pick a shirt to wear randomly. Once you've worn the shirt, you can't wear it again until you've worn all your other shirts and done your laundry. Create a function to help you pick which shirt you should wear.</p>
    <p>Bonus: if you don't like the shirt that is picked, you should be able to 'send it back' and get another clean shirt. The unworn shirt goes back with the other clean shirts. You can do this as many times as you want.</p>
